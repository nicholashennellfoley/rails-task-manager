Background & Objectives
Let‚Äôs build a To Do Manager with the basic CRUD features:

As a user, I can list tasks
As a user, I can view the details of a task
As a user, I can add a new task
As a user, I can edit a task (mark as completed / update title & details)
As a user, I can remove a task
In this challenge, you will meet your old friend Active Record again, which is Rails‚Äô ORM.

There is no rake here, and do not create your Rails app in fullstack-challenges ‚õîÔ∏è Instead, please follow these instructions:

cd ~/code/nicholashennellfoley
rails new rails-task-manager --skip-active-storage --skip-action-mailbox
cd rails-task-manager
git add .
git commit -m "rails new"
gh repo create --public --source=.
git push origin master
Specs
1 - Model
Generate the Task model through the right rails generator. It should have at least the following columns:

title, as a string
details, as a text
completed, as a boolean (default: false)
2 - Controller
Generate an empty (no actions) TasksController with the right rails generator.

For this exercise, do not use resources in your config/routes.rb. The goal of this exercise is to re-build the regular CRUD from scratch.

3 - As a user, I can list tasks
First, add a new route to list the tasks, following the convention from the lecture. Then, add a controller action and its view. This action should fetch all tasks, and a view should loop over these to display them, like in the screenshot below.

To test your view, you need some tasks in the database! To create some, run a rails console in another terminal tab and then run:

Task.create(title: "Laundry", details: "Do not mix colors!")
Task.create(title: "Studying", details: "A lot of flashcards to do", completed: true)
‚ö†Ô∏è In the view, do not focus on coding the checkboxes visual for now. You will have the opportunity to code it in the optional questions.



4 - As a user, I can view the details of a task
We now have a list of tasks, and we would like to click on the task title and navigate to a new page, displaying the details of this task. Following the conventions from the lecture, add a new route, a new controller action and a new view. This action should find a specific task, thanks to its id, directly from params.

Update the index.html.erb view with the link_to helper to build the links.

‚ö†Ô∏è Again, in the view, do not focus on coding the checkboxes visual for now. You will have the opportunity to code it in the optional questions.



5 - As a user, I can add a new task
Following the lecture conventions, add two routes to handle the creation of a task. One route is there to display the Task form, and another one is there to handle the POST request generated when submitting this form. Try to use directly the form_with helper in your view.



6 - As a user, I can edit a task
We want to be able to edit a task, changing its title, its details and especially marking it as completed. Following the lecture conventions, add the two routes you need for that feature. Implement the controller actions, and the views.



7 - As a user, I can remove a task
Last feature, we want to be able to destroy tasks directly from the list. A JavaScript confirmation could be handy.



8 - Refactoring (Optional)
Have a critical look at your code and introduce the following refactoring:

Use resources in your config/routes.rb
Use a before_action in the TasksController
Should we DRY a bit the new and edit views? How can we handle the fact that the new form should not display ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù? (hint)
9 - Front-end (Optional)
Install Bootstrap stylesheets

Following the documentation, install Bootstrap to your Rails app by copy-pasting the link tag in the head of the application.html.erb layout:

<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->
<!-- [...] -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
You can now use any Bootstrap class anywhere in your Rails views üéâ

Install Font Awesome

Add Font Awesome link tag in the head of your layout:

<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->
<!-- [...] -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.1.2/css/all.css">
You can now use any of the free Font Awesome icons üéâ Try to find nice checkbox icons!

In your view, use conditionals. If your task is completed, display the checked square, else, display an empty square.
